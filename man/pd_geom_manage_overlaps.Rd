\title{Manage overlapping markings in pain drawings}
\usage{
pd_geom_manage_overlaps(pd, method = "merge")
}
\arguments{
\item{pd}{A valid pain drawing data structure -- see [pd_check] for details.}

\item{method}{A string -- eigher "merge", "split", "adoptA" or "adoptB" -- currently only "merge" is implemented}
}
\value{
A valid pain drawing data structure
}
\description{
This function will  overlapping markings/strokes in pain drawings by the chosen method. The method <chr> can be 'merge', 'split', 'adoptA' or 'adoptB'.
}
\details{
The `method` parameter determines the way overlaps are managed:
* "merge" will create a union of pairwise overlapping markings -- note i) this will result in the first marking being extended as the union of the two and the second marking will be deleted, ii) any enclosed 'holes' generated by the union will be ignored and incorporated in the resulting marking.
* "split" will subtract the overlapping area from both markings and create a new marking representing the overlap -- not currently implemented!
* "adoptA" will retain the first of the markings unchanged, and subtract the overlap from the second marking -- not currently implemented!
* "adoptB" will retain the second of the markings unchanged, and subtract the overlap from the first marking -- not currently implemented!
