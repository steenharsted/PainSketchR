\title{Clean pain drawings for duplicates, no-area polygons, etc}
\usage{
pd_geom_cleanup(pd, minarea = 0, noarea = "buffer", delta = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pd}{A valid pain drawing data structure -- see [pd_check] for more detail.}

\item{minarea}{A numeric value representing the minimum value of polygon areas to retain}

\item{noarea}{A string specifying how to manage polygons with no area (points and lines) -- accepted values: "drop" and "buffer"}

\item{delta}{A numeric value representing the buffering zone -- only relevant if noarea is set to "buffer"}
}
\value{
A pain drawing data structure
}
\description{
Pain drawings are subject to whatever input users have seen fit to add. This may include
markings or 'stroke' like isolated points and two-point lines, which have no area. 
Furthermore, data may contain duplicate entries or markings with no actual points. This functions 
can help eliminate such data.

\examples{
pd_geom_cleanup(my_paindrawings, noarea="buffer", delta=20)
