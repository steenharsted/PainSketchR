Description: This package aims to aid in the quatification of pain drawings.
    Pain drawings are typically used in a clinical context, e.g. low back pain, 
    where patients are invited to illustrate the pain distribution on a schematic
    outline of the human body. Historically, these pain drawings were completed
    using pen and paper with a body silhuette pre-printed. Today, they are 
    typically collected using digital interfaces like a webpage or an app on 
    a tablet. There are basically two methods of collecting such data. Either as
    simple categorical data (did the patient draw a pain area including the 'left
    lower back'? yes or no, and similarly for other anatomical regions). This
    approache was (among others) published by Margolis several decades ago and
    lends it self well to pen-and-paper pain drawings. 
    Another approach which is more easily recorded using digital interfaces, is
    to capture the actual pen strokes as series of x and y coordinate data. This
    is also more difficult to manage and in some cases interpret.
